The `Browser` class manages the browser under test. This includes activities within the browser, but outside the rendered DOM of the application. Actions such as navigation, alert handling, cookie management, and switching between browser windows, are all handled by the `Browser`. The methods on the `Browser` class are static, and are able to be called from anywhere within the scope of the test, be it from the UI Modeling layer or directly from the test itself.
