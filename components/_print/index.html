    <div class="lead">These objects, from the <code>dev.qadenz.automation.config</code> package, handle Suite and Test configuration tasks.</div>
	<h2 id="automatedwebtest">AutomatedWebTest</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/config/AutomatedWebTest.java"><code>AutomatedWebTest</code></a> is the base class for all test classes in a Qadenz-powered test project. This class is responsible for gathering parameter values from the TestNG Suite XML file, configuring and starting a <code>WebDriver</code> instance on a Selenium Grid for each test method, stopping the <code>WebDriver</code> after each test, and invoking the reporters after the Suite has completed.</p>
<p>Classes that hold <code>@Test</code> methods must extend this class in order for tests to run using Qadenz configurations.</p>
<h3 id="the-execution-cycle">The Execution Cycle</h3>
<p><strong>Before the Suite Begins</strong></p>
<p>The first task performed after launching a Suite execution is to capture a timestamp and save as the <code>suiteStartDate</code> value on the <code>WebConfig</code>. This will be used later by the reporter to calculate the duration of the execution. Next, the Suite-level parameters are retrieved from the <code>ITestContext</code>, which were specified by the user on the TestNG Suite XML file. The  <code>gridHost</code> is validated and saved.</p>
<p><strong>Before Each Test</strong></p>
<p>Repeated before each test method, the Test-level parameters are retrieved from the <code>ITestContext</code>, which are the <code>browser</code>, <code>browserVersion</code>, <code>browserConfigProfile</code>, <code>platform</code>, <code>timeout</code>, <code>appUrl</code>, <code>retryInterceptedClicks</code>. These parameters are validated and saved to the <code>WebConfig</code>.</p>
<p>Once all the parameters are processed, the <code>WebDriver</code> can be launched and execution of a test method can begin. The <code>CapabilityProvider</code> is invoked to configure the browser session. The <code>CapabilityProvider</code> calls values on the <code>WebConfig</code> and attempts to load any Browser Config Profiles declared in one of the browser configuration JSON files. This process chooses a browser, determines if a specific version of the browser is required if a version has been declared, ensures that the test will be run on the appropriate OS if one has been specified, and applies any arguments provided on the JSON file if a matching Browser Config Profile was found.</p>
<p>These options are then used to configure and initialize a <code>WebDriver</code> instance, which is in turn set on the <code>WebDriverProvider</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, the browser window is maximized, and the <code>appUrl</code> value is loaded.</p>
<p><strong>After Each Test</strong></p>
<p>At the end of each test method, the <code>WebDriver</code> is stopped.</p>
<p><strong>After the Suite Ends</strong></p>
<p>The final task of the execution cycle is to capture a second timestamp as the <code>suiteEndDate</code> on the <code>WebConfig</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting</strong></p>
<p>The default TestNG reporters are not disabled by default, so the standard HTML &amp; XML reports will be generated, along with the <code>emailable-report.html</code>. Next, the <code>TestReporter</code> is invoked which generates the Qadenz Reports in JSON and HTML formats.</p>
<h2 id="webconfig">WebConfig</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/config/WebConfig.java"><code>WebConfig</code></a> stores information that Qadenz uses at various points throughout the execution cycle. Primarily, these are the values given as parameters on the TestNG Suite XML file. While Qadenz calls these values during the setup and reporting phases they are made available on the chance these values are needed for any project-specific configuration.</p>
<p>Since these fields are all static, there really is no need to extend this class. Teams are encouraged to follow this pattern, though, and create a ProjectConfig class of their own should the need arise to track specific values or project-specific Suite parameters are in play.</p>
<h2 id="webdriverprovider">WebDriverProvider</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/config/WebDriverProvider.java"><code>WebDriverProvider</code></a> stores the <code>WebDriver</code> instance and makes it available to components where it is needed. Since the test classes work on an inheritance hierarchy, and with how TestNG manages threads, the <code>WebDriver</code> instance is required to be kept on a <code>ThreadLocal&lt;WebDriver&gt;</code> object. Rather than forcing testers to pass the <code>WebDriver</code> around to various library components, Qadenz has chosen to make the <code>ThreadLocal</code> static, and allow components that need the <code>WebDriver</code> to call a centralized location. On the (hopefully) rare occurrence where the <code>WebDriver</code> is needed directly, it can be invoked with the following call.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>WebDriver webDriver = WebDriverProvider.getWebDriver();
</code></pre><h2 id="browser-configuration-profiles">Browser Configuration Profiles</h2>
<p>In some cases, extra configuration arguments need to be passed to the browser Options instance for <code>WebDriver</code> configuration. A common case for this is instructing a browser to run in headless mode. Qadenz provides a simple means to set these configurations, and allows for multiple &ldquo;profiles&rdquo; of these configurations to be set on the TestNG Suite XML file. For example, if a tester wishes to run in headless mode on the Selenium Grid, but run in a native browser when executing locally, the switch is as simple as altering a parameter value.</p>
<p>Configurations are stored in JSON files within the project&rsquo;s <code>resources</code> directory. To create a new configuration, within the <code>resources</code> directory, add a new folder called <code>config</code>, and create a new JSON file. This file must be named <code>{browser}-config.json</code>, where <code>{browser}</code> is the name of the browser being configured. A separate file must be created for each browser
requiring configuration.</p>
<p>This example configures Chrome to run in headless mode.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[
    {
        &#34;profile&#34;: &#34;headless&#34;,
        &#34;args&#34;: [
            &#34;--headless&#34;,
            &#34;--window-size=1920,1080&#34;,
            &#34;--disable-gpu&#34;
        ]
    }
]
</code></pre><p>The JSON format is an array of configuration objects. Each object holds <code>profile</code> and <code>args</code> fields. The <code>profile</code> field will be matched to the <code>browserConfigProfile</code> parameter on the Suite XML. The <code>args</code> is an array of individual arguments to be passed to the <code>WebDriver</code> configuration.</p>

    <div class="lead">The classes from the <code>dev.qadenz.automation.commands</code> package are a collection of functionality that execute actions against elements on the UI, or the browser itself. In short, these are test steps ranging from actions such as clicks and inputs, inspections such as reading text or determining the state of an element, browser actions such as navigation or window management, and validations.</div>
	<h2 id="commands">Commands</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/commands/Commands.java"><code>Commands</code></a> class is abstract and sits atop the Commands Hierarchy. This class provides common commands and is completely agnostic of any underlying automation frameworks.</p>
<p><code>Commands</code> is home to the validation functionality (explained [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/qadenz/validations.md %})), as well as the <code>log()</code> and <code>annotate()</code> commands (explained [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/qadenz/logging-and-reporting.md %})).</p>
<h2 id="the-webcommander">The WebCommander</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/commands/WebCommander.java"><code>WebCommander</code></a> is a child of <code>Commands</code>, and wraps Selenium <code>WebElement</code> and <code>Actions</code> commands for use in tests and UI Models. Each of the methods on <code>WebCommander</code> provide a number of activities beyond simply performing Selenium actions. The workflow for <code>WebCommander</code> methods is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log the action taking place and the name of the target element.</li>
<li>Initialize a <code>WebElement</code> using the provided <code>Locator</code> instance.</li>
<li>Perform the <code>WebElement</code> or <code>Actions</code> command.</li>
<li>Catch and log any exceptions that are thrown.</li>
<li>If an exception is caught, capture a screenshot of the UI under test.</li>
<li>Throw the exception to stop execution of the test.</li>
</ol>
<p>All <code>WebCommander</code> commands include an Explicit Wait during <code>WebElement</code> initialization. Commands that involve a Click action include a wait for the clickability of the target element. All other commands include a wait for the visibility of the target element to be <code>true</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-webinspector">The WebInspector</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/commands/WebInspector.java"><code>WebInspector</code></a> class works alongside the <code>WebCommander</code>. Instead of performing actions on UI elements, <code>WebInspector</code> work to extract and return data from UI elements. This includes retrieving text or attribute values from elements, and discovering selected, enabled, or visible state of elements. The workflow for <code>WebInspector</code> methods is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log the action taking place and the name of the target element.</li>
<li>Initialize a <code>WebElement</code> using the provided <code>Locator</code> instance.</li>
<li>Retrieve the required information from the <code>WebElement</code>.</li>
<li>Catch and log any exceptions that are thrown.</li>
<li>If an exception is caught, capture a screenshot of the UI under test.</li>
<li>Throw the exception to stop execution of the test.</li>
</ol>
<p>All <code>WebInspector</code> commands that involve a single target element also include an Explicit Wait during <code>WebElement</code> initialization for the visibility of the target element to be <code>true</code>. Commands that involve a <code>List&lt;WebElement&gt;</code> do not include an Explicit Wait.</p>
<h3 id="constructors--loggers">Constructors &amp; Loggers</h3>
<p>The <code>WebCommander</code> and <code>WebInspector</code> can be instantiated and used either from the tests directly, or from the UI Modeling layer, depending on the design of the test project. Both <code>WebCommander</code> and <code>WebInspector</code> have overloaded constructors that enable different types of logging to take place, and will both directly impact how the logs are presented on the report output.</p>
<p>The <code>WebCommander</code> constructor is used as an example, but the <code>WebInspector</code> shares this same pattern:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>private Logger LOG;

public WebCommander() {
    super();
    LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(WebCommander.class);
}

public WebCommander(Class&lt;?&gt; logger) {
    super(logger);
    LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(logger);
}
</code></pre><p>The no-args constructor is generic and can be used regardless of how the classes are consumed. This constructor assigns the <code>WebCommander.class</code> as the <code>Logger</code>, and all logging output for method calls on this class will be shown to originate from the <code>WebCommander</code> class. If the UI of the application under test is very simple, or the team simply does not require a level of detail in the logging that ties actions to specific UI Models, then this constructor will provide an ideal configuration.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>09:55:00.939 | INFO | WebCommander | Entering text [admin@qadenz.dev] into element [Username Field].
09:55:01.308 | INFO | WebCommander | Entering text [Test123$] into element [Password Field].

09:55:02.998 | INFO | Commands | Result - PASS
</code></pre><p>The overloaded constructor requires a <code>Class&lt;?&gt;</code> argument, and allows for another class reference to be injected as the logger for the <code>WebCommander</code> instance. If <code>WebCommander</code> is being instantiated from a Page Object, and the Page Object class is passed to the constructor, the logs and reporting output will be shown to originate from the Page Object itself, resulting in a greater level of detail in the logs and reports. By using the class injection for the logger, commands will be logged in the context of the page where the command was executed.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>09:55:00.939 | INFO | LoginPage | Entering text [admin@qadenz.dev] into element [Username Field].

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/commands/Browser.java"><code>Browser</code></a> class manages the browser under test. This includes activities within the browser, but outside the rendered DOM of the application. Actions such as navigation, alert handling, cookie management, and switching between browser windows, are all handled by the <code>Browser</code>.

    <div class="lead">The pairing of <a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/conditions/Conditions.java"><code>Conditions</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/conditions/Expectations.java"><code>Expectations</code></a> becomes the core evaluative logic of Qadenz. These classes are used to determine if the state of the UI under test meets a given criteria.</div>
	<p>When used with the Explicit Wait provided by the <code>pause()</code> command, or with the Assertions provided by the <code>verify()</code> and <code>check()</code> commands, a Condition is used to describe precisely what on the UI is being evaluated, and the accompanying Expectation describes exactly the expected outcome of the evaluation.</p>
<p>The goal of the Condition/Expectation pairing is to provide a unified structure for making evaluations throughout a testing project, rather than mixing Selenium <code>ExpectedConditions</code> calls for Explicit Waits, and various syntax patterns for test assertions. The resulting code is simple to read and quickly understand, and is easily maintained as the application under test evolves.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>Each Condition accepts a variety of Expectations based on the type of evaluation being performed. For example, Conditions pertaining to element state (visibility, selected, enabled) accept boolean-based Expectations, while Conditions evaluating text will require String-based Expectations.</p>
<p>Conditions and Expectations are powered by Hamcrest. The return value of a Condition is based on whether the outcome of the evaluation matched the expected result. The Condition will return <code>true</code> is there was a match, <code>false</code> otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="logging-evaluations">Logging evaluations</h2>
<p>Implementations of the <a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/conditions/Condition.java"><code>Condition</code></a> interface will provide a description of the Condition under evaluation to the logs and subsequent report output. Should the evaluation fail to match with the Expectation, the Condition will also provide a summary of the actual results.</p>
<p>Implementations of the <a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/conditions/Expectation.java"><code>Expectation</code></a> interface will provide a description of the Expectation that will be added to the Condition logs, as well as the wrapped Hamcrest Matcher that will be used to compute the result of the Condition.</p>

	<h1 id="pg-578d1cb9f49197730d0f0eb4da2085cd">4 - Logging &amp; Reporting</h1>
    <div class="lead">Logs tell a very important story during the lifecycle of any software application, and a testing library is no different.</div>
	<p>In fact, it could easily be argued that logging in a testing context is doubly important in order to capture all the details of what happened during the execution cycle. It&rsquo;s the step by step details that tell us what a test was doing when something goes wrong, which in turn helps us testers to more quickly understand and recreate these failure scenarios so that system defects can be reported earlier in the testing cycle.</p>
<p>Qadenz uses two primary loggers to tell the story of an execution run. The Suite Logger monitors major activity with the execution run itself and captures events outside of the individual tests. This includes setup and tear-down activities, configuration details, the starting and stopping of tests, and errors that are encountered during the reporting phase. The Test Logger captures the step by step details of each test that runs as part of a Suite. This includes every action, inspection, validation, and any errors that are encountered along the way.</p>
<p>Qadenz uses Logback to handle all logging within the library. These logs are presented on the console during a Suite execution, and are also used to generate content for the Qadenz HTML Reporter.</p>
<p>Each log event will contain a timestamp, the logging level, the name of the logger,</p>
<h2 id="console-logging">Console Logging</h2>
<p>The console logs will show output from both the Suite Logger and the Test Logger. These will be present when running locally either from Maven or within an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, as well as in build systems like Jenkins or TeamCity. The console logs are the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; log output, showing all events in chronological order, regardless of origin. This means events reported inside test methods that are run in parallel will be shown in the same output. To facilitate better tracing of these events, the console logger is configured to add a thread identifier to each event.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Add log output example
</code></pre><p>The Suite Logger output can be identified by <code>Thread: main</code>, and the Test Logger output for each test can be identified by a numbered idntifier, such as <code>Thread: 1</code>,  based on how many tests are executed in parallel.</p>
<p>The console logs are beneficial for local debugging of tests, providing a fast and easy view into the events and any errors encountered during the execution of a problematic test.</p>
<h2 id="the-qadenz-html-reporter">The Qadenz HTML Reporter</h2>
<p>The Qadenz HTML Reporter is the primary view of test results. This report was originally inspired by the TestNG <code>emailable-report.html</code>, but sought to make some key improvements to both the level of detail in the report, and general user experience.</p>
<p>The TestNG emailable report is sufficient for a count and listing of tests that passed and failed, and some basic insight on any exceptions that were caught during a test, but is lacking for any additional detail. There are other libraries that generate HTML reports, but can be cumbersome to use and may introduce additional code management overhead in order to integrate with tests and UI models.</p>
<p>Qadenz solves this problem by leveraging the Logback loggers to generate the detailed content for each test, and integrating directly with TestNG to generate and calculate results.</p>
<h3 id="report-output">Report Output</h3>
<p>The Qadenz HTML report header shows the Suite Name as given on the Suite XML file, the date and time the execution run was launched, test counts (total, passed, failed, stopped, skipped), and an overall duration for the run.</p>
<p>Next, the classes and methods invoked by each <code>&lt;test&gt;</code> node on the Suite XML will be present in blocks. The name given in the <code>&lt;test&gt;</code> node will be present, followed by an expandable list of test classes. Failed tests will be listed first, followed by Stopped tests, then Skipped, followed by Passed.</p>
<p>Expanding a class entry on the list will expose a list of methods from the same class that were included in the run and that fall within the current result section. The same class may be listed in multiple sections depending on the final outcome of the included tests. If a <code>@DataProvider</code> has been used with the tests, the parameters from the Data Provider will be listed next to the name of the test method.</p>
<p>Next, expanding a test entry will expose the individual logs for the test. The report will show the start time and duration for each test method, followed by the detailed logging output from the test. In Failed and Stopped tests, each failure and error will be accompanied by a &ldquo;View Screenshot&rdquo; link. Clicking this link will open the screenshot image in a modal for viewing.</p>
<h3 id="failed-vs-stopped-tests">Failed vs Stopped Tests</h3>
<p>Default TestNG behavior is to classify any test that throws any exception as a failed test. Qadenz introduces a new result type called &ldquo;Stopped&rdquo; to allow some granularity in how test results can be sorted and analyzed.</p>
<p>Qadenz considers a &ldquo;Failed&rdquo; test to be a test that contains one or more failed validations, and considers a &ldquo;Stopped&rdquo; test to be a test that has thrown any other exception. This includes timing/sync issues, missing elements, etc.</p>
<p>By limiting the &ldquo;Failed&rdquo; category to validation failures, this allows teams to focus their post-execution results analysis on the tests that could potentially be more likely to produce a defect. This does not preclude Stopped tests from being so due to system defects, nor does it preclude Failed tests from being so due to issues in the tests. This is simply a means to draw attention specifically to tests that have failed due to validations that did not meed expectations, and those that have failed due to other reasons.</p>
<h3 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h3>
<p>The Qadenz HTML report is completely inclusive of all detailed reporting content and screenshots. The ease of distribution is the same as the TestNG emailable report.</p>
<p>Screenshots in the Qadenz library are captured and immediately encoded to a Base64 String, which is then added to the report. This allows the images to be embedded directly into the report and to be shared without having to work with cumbersome zip files or deal with broken image links.</p>

	<h1 id="pg-46fff6a698a84d53d8901f923278e0b2">5 - Validations</h1>
    <div class="lead">Making assertions with Conditions and Expectations</div>
	<p>Qadenz is built with a versatile and easy to use approach to performing validations against the UI under test. The key component of this approach is the inclusion of <code>Conditions</code> and <code>Expectations</code> as evaluation criteria for validations. These classes combine Selenium <code>WebElement</code> inspections to retrieve the &lsquo;actual&rsquo; state of the UI, with Hamcrest Matchers to provide the &rsquo;expected&rsquo; state, to return a result that represents a passing or failing outcome.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-assertions">Why not Assertions?</h2>
<p>Unit testing frameworks such as TestNG or JUnit include assertion functionality as a core component, and are relatively simple to use. Being open-ended frameworks, however, individual users may tend to express very similar validations in a variety of different assertions. This leads to inconsistent coding patterns, and more difficult maintenance of test code.</p>
<p>Using <code>Conditions</code> and <code>Expectations</code> allows a team to ensure all contributors are following the same pattern for validations.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Conditions.textOfElement(greetingText, Expectations.isEqualTo(&#34;Hello World!&#34;);
</code></pre><p>That said, Qadenz does employ a single TestNG assertion, the <code>assertTrue()</code> method, as a means of validating a Condition. The <code>result()</code> of a Condition is a simple representation of whether the state of the UI under test meets expectation. If the output of the Condition evaluation matches the Expectation, <code>result()</code> will return <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>By passing this result to the <code>assertTrue()</code> method, Qadenz is ensuring that a passing result depends on the Condition evaluation meeting the Expectation. If not, the validation will fail.</p>
<h2 id="assertion-types">Assertion Types</h2>
<p>The concept of Hard Assertions and Soft Assertions are not new in the test automation world. Qadenz implements both concepts by way of the <code>verify()</code> and <code>check()</code> methods.</p>
<p><code>verify()</code> represents a Hard Assertion. If the validation fails, the test will be marked as failed and execution will be stopped.</p>
<p><code>check()</code> represents a Soft Assertion. If the validation fails, the test will be marked as failed, but execution will be allowed to continue until a call to <code>Assertions.flush()</code> is made, which will stop execution of the test if any failures have been encountered.</p>
<p>The <code>verify()</code> or <code>check()</code> methods are available on the Commands Hierarchy and are callable on any descendant class of <code>Commands</code>. The mechanics of using these validations are the same, with the only difference being an additional step with <code>check()</code> required to call <code>Assertions.flush()</code> in order to handle any failed Soft Assertions and stop execution.</p>
<h2 id="grouped-conditions">Grouped Conditions</h2>
<p>Validations in Qadenz are further enhanced with the ability to evaluate multiple Conditions as a group. In scenarios where a single UI action can trigger multiple verification points in a test, a tester may have to express multiple assert statements to ensure necessary coverage. If, for example, the first assertion were to fail, the remaining assertions would remain unchecked until either the UI under test is fixed, or the test scenario is executed manually.</p>
<p>Using Qadenz, a tester is able to execute these same validations in one call to <code>verify()</code> or <code>check()</code>, and will receive results for each Condition evaluation regardless of individual results. If again, the first validation fails, Qadenz will perform handling tasks on the failure, then proceed to evaluate each of the other Conditions that were passed. In the case of a <code>verify()</code> with multiple Conditions where one or more have failed, halting of test execution will be delayed until all Conditions have been evaluated, which will ensure that the test step is completed in its entirety.</p>
<p>In the example below, a user has added an item to the shopping cart, and the next step will verify a snackbar notification is displayed with a confirmation message, the item quantity is shown on the shopping cart icon, and the &lsquo;Checkout Now&rsquo; button is enabled.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>commander.verify(
        Conditions.textOfElement(snackBarNotification, Expectations.isEqualTo(&#34;Items added successfully!&#34;)),
        Conditions.textOfElement(quantityInCartIndicator, Expectations.isEqualTo(&#34;1&#34;)),
        Conditions.enabledStateOfElement(checkOutNowButton, Expectations.isTrue()));
</code></pre><p>By grouping these verifications together, even if one (or more) Conditions fail, all will be evaluated and reported individually.</p>
<h2 id="managing-soft-assertions">Managing Soft Assertions</h2>
<p>The <code>check()</code> methods works alongside the static <code>Assertions.flush()</code> method to delay execution stoppages in the event of failed validations. As calls to <code>check()</code> are made and executed through the course of a test, the <a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/commands/Assertions.java"><code>Assertions</code></a> class tracks whether any failures have been encountered. When the call to <code>Assertions.flush()</code> is made, this tracker is checked. If any failures are present, execution will be stopped. If no failures are found, execution continues.</p>
<p>Since the tracker is live for the entire duration of a test, there is no limit to how many calls to <code>Assertions.flush()</code> can be made throughout a test. It is possible then, to create a series of &ldquo;checkpoints&rdquo; in longer tests whenever it is deemed sensible to stop a test if failures have been found. This is especially convenient for smoke to end-to-end tests where a focus on completion of test is important for a full accounting of key validation points.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that at least one call to <code>Assertions.flush()</code> is required in tests where only <code>check()</code> validations are made. If no call is made, the test will be allowed to continue to completion, and individual steps will be reported as failed (if validations have indeed failed), but the test as a whole will be reported as passing. Since the Qadenz reporter is integrated with TestNG, the <code>AssertionError</code> thrown by the <code>flush()</code> method in the event of individual failures is required to mark the test itself as failed.</p>
<p>One additional design consideration must be made when mixing <code>verify()</code> and <code>check()</code> validations within the same test. When a <code>check()</code> validation is made, and is followed by a <code>verify()</code> validation prior to calling <code>Assertions.flush()</code>, if the <code>verify()</code> validation fails, the test will be stopped at the failed <code>verify()</code> validation.</p>
<h2 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h2>
<p>Qadenz validations are built to capture screenshots whenever a Condition evaluation fails. If screenshots are desired for validation failures, no special action need be taken. Should screenshots <em>not</em> be needed for a validation, disabling is easy with the overloaded <code>verify()</code> and <code>check()</code> methods.</p>
<p>Adding a call to <code>Screenshot.SKIP</code> as the first argument in either <code>verify()</code> or <code>check()</code> will disable screenshots from being captured if the evaluations for any accompanying Conditions fail.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>verify(Screenshot.SKIP, Conditions.visibilityOfElement(locator, Expectations.isTrue());
</code></pre><p>A <code>boolean</code> could also be passed to achieve the same outcome. The <code>Screenshot.SKIP</code> value is intended as a means to keep the resulting code easily readable at a glance.</p>

    <div class="lead">Modeling the UI Under Test</div>
	<p>Qadenz is a departure from the commonly practiced use of the Selenium Page Factory pattern when implementing the Page Object Model. The <code>@FindBy</code> annotation-based approach to mapping UI elements lacks the ability to parameterize selectors. Instead, testers are forced to create repetitive annotated <code>WebElement</code> instances for every needed permutation of a selector. Without adding additional calls to <code>WebDriverWait</code> in order to use an Explicit Wait to initialize the element (and dealing with the resulting added clutter), these selectors are notoriously susceptible to the dreaded <code>StaleElementReferenceException</code>.</p>
<p>In short, Qadenz is quite happy to follow Simon Stewart&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyfUpOysIF8&amp;t=1519s">advice</a>, and find a better way.</p>
<p>The UI Modeling strategy behind Qadenz centers around the <a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/ui/Locator.java"><code>Locator</code></a> object, and rather than mix between all the different selector types, Qadenz has chosen CSS selectors exclusively.</p>
<h2 id="why-only-css-selectors">Why only CSS Selectors?</h2>
<p>Many teams will choose either a default standard selector strategy (ID, CSS, XPath, etc.), or at least set an order of prioritization for the varying types. Qadenz has chosen CSS selectors for the superior performance, ease of use, and better browser compatibility when compared to XPath. The addition of the <a href="https://github.com/jquery/sizzle">SizzleJS</a> library provides a number of pseudo-classes that make element selection more flexible and accurate.</p>
<p>The end result is a powerful and straightforward selector strategy that supports full parameterization capabilities. This also leads to a singular defined approach that an entire team can adopt and consistently apply across the entire project.</p>
<h2 id="the-locator">The Locator</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/ui/Locator.java"><code>Locator</code></a> is the primary component of UI Modeling in the Qadenz environment. This object simply carries the name of an element, the element&rsquo;s CSS Selector, and an optional parent Locator instance to assist with abstracting element relationships and re-using selector content. The <code>Locator</code> is passed to methods on classes such as the <a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/commands/WebCommander.java"><code>WebCommander</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/commands/WebInspector.java"><code>WebInspector</code></a>, which will then use the data within to initialize WebElements with the <a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/ui/WebFinder.java"><code>WebFinder</code></a>.</p>
<p>The <code>Locator</code> provides several major advantages over the <code>@FindBy</code> and <code>PageFactory</code>.</p>
<h3 id="context-friendly-element-names">Context-friendly Element Names</h3>
<p>Selenium does not readily (nor should it, being simply the tool that automates browsers) provide a meaningful context-friendly reference to element names, which can complicate debugging and troubleshooting when problems arise. Without additional logging in the test project, testers are generally only provided references to elements expressed as the given selectors. This has a very strong potential to slow down the resolution process as testers must first translate the selector in their stack trace to an actual element on the UI, which can then establish a point of orientation within the progression of test steps.</p>
<p>By requiring a <code>name</code> value to be given in the <code>Locator</code> constructor, Qadenz refers to the context-friendly name of an element as the primary identifier in all logging and reporting output. This eliminates the time needed to perform any lookup or cross-referencing of selectors to elements in relation to test steps. By reviewing the default logging output or report content, the point at which a problem appears in a test is clearly marked and quickly identified.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Locator signInButton = new Locator(&#34;Sign In Button&#34;, &#34;.btn-signIn&#34;);
</code></pre><h3 id="parameterized-selectors">Parameterized Selectors</h3>
<p>Using list of search results as an example, testers would be forced to create a separate <code>@FindBy</code> annotated <code>WebElement</code> instance for each result element needed for a test. Alternately, a <code>@FindBy</code> could be used to initialize a single <code>List&lt;WebElement&gt;</code>, but additional logic would be necessary to identify a specific result element needed for a test step. In either case, the result is many extra lines of code.</p>
<p>Using a parameterized Locator (coupled with the benefits of Sizzle CSS Selectors), testers will be able to define a single <code>Locator</code> instance for a generic search result, and rely upon the parameterization to direct the test to choose the appropriate element instance.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>public Locator searchResultLink(String name) {
    return new Locator(name + &#34; Search Result Link&#34;, &#34;.search-result:contains(&#34; + name + &#34;)&#34;);
}
</code></pre><p>In this example, we also have a benefit of passing the parameter to the <code>name</code> field on the Locator, which increases clarity in the logs and reports by providing the exact instance of the element against which the interaction takes place.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-fly-element-initialization">On-the-fly Element Initialization</h3>
<p>Using <code>PageFactory.initElements()</code> will instantiate the page class, and all <code>WebElement</code> instances annotated with <code>@FindBy</code> will be initialized. If the page on the UI is static and all mapped elements are already present, there should be no issues. Modern web-apps, though, use very dynamic interfaces. This frequently results in situations where some <code>@FindBy</code> mapped elements will change state at some point between the time <code>.initElements()</code> is called and when the element is actually used. To mitigate these issues, additional code in the form of Explicit Waits or other custom logic must be written to handle each element.</p>
<p>With Qadenz, Locators are defined and passed to commands methods, which in turn initialize a <code>WebElement</code> prior to acting upon the element. Further, each command will initialize the target element each time the command is called. By initializing WebElements <em>at the time they are used</em>, this mitigates situations that might produce a <code>StaleElementReferenceException</code>, and when errors are encountered, the problem can be presented far more clearly.</p>
<h2 id="using-locators">Using Locators</h2>
<p>A simple standard <code>Locator</code> can be defined by providing a friendly name and a valid CSS Selector to the constructor. A number of optional methods are available, however, to enhance both the convenience and capability of a Locator. These include abstracting selector segments, and additional configuration values that will aid any determinations that are made of various states of the element.</p>
<h3 id="parent-locators">Parent Locators</h3>
<p>The <code>Locator</code> can hold a third, optional value of another <code>Locator</code> instance. This is intended to allow abstraction of selector segments by combining the selector of the parent Locator with that of the current Locator as a single selector value. This can be helpful in reducing repeated selector segments when creating Locators for closely related UI Elements.</p>
<p>Consider an e-commerce application wherein a list of catalog items are presented on the UI. Each item card contains the item name text, a &lsquo;Cost&rsquo; value, a &lsquo;Quantity&rsquo; field, and an &lsquo;Add to Cart&rsquo; button.</p>
<p>As a very simple HTML representation:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;div id=&#34;item-list-section&#34; class=&#34;grid&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;item-row even&#34;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;item-card&#34;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&#34;item-name&#34;&gt;ACME Rocket Powered Roller Skates&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&#34;item-cost&#34;&gt;$99.99&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&#34;item-qty input-field&#34;&gt;
                &lt;input type=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&#34;item-add action-button&#34;&gt;
                &lt;button type=&#34;submit&#34;&gt;Add to Cart&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
</code></pre><p>The selector for the &lsquo;Add to Cart&rsquo; button could be:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#item-list-section .item-card:contains(ACME Rocket Powered Roller Skates) .item-add button
</code></pre><p>While mapping the other elements on an item card, however, it would be discovered that the item card selector itself is repeated on each of the child elements. In this situation, a parent <code>Locator</code> could be created to abstract the repeated selector segments, especially if the abstracted selector can stand as it&rsquo;s own element mapping.</p>
<p>With a parent <code>Locator</code> the resulting element mappings for the item card, &lsquo;Quantity&rsquo; field, and &lsquo;Add to Cart&rsquo; button could be:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>public Locator itemCard(String itemName) {
    return new Locator(itemName + &#34; Item Card&#34;, &#34;#item-list-section .item-card:contains(&#34; + itemName + &#34;)&#34;);
}
public Locator itemQuantityField(String itemName) {
    return new Locator(itemName + &#34; Quantity Field&#34;, itemCard(itemName), &#34; .item-qty input&#34;);
}
public Locator itemAddToCartButton(String itemName) {
    return new Locator(itemName + &#34; Add to Cart Button&#34;, itemCard(itemName), &#34; .item-add button&#34;);
}
</code></pre><p>In the above example, the <code>itemCard()</code> Locator could have the added benefit of not only being an abstracted selector, but could also serve as the target element of a verification of a given item card element to be visible on the page.</p>
<p>Parent Locators are also not limited to a single layer. Locators can be passed as parent references as many times as needed.</p>
<h2 id="definable-element-state-attributes">Definable Element State Attributes</h2>
<p>There are some cases where the UI under test experiences conditions where traditional element state inspections are unreliable due to styling, DOM structure, UI framework in use, or perhaps even unconventional UI development. This can sometimes produce incorrect results on inspections like visibility, selected, or enabled states. To mitigate this issue, the <code>Locator</code> allows three additional fields to be set to assist evaluating these element states.</p>
<p>These fields are available as setter methods on the <code>Locator</code> class, and each will define an HTML attribute and expected value that will be added to the corresponding element inspection methods on <code>WebInspector</code>. Each of these methods are overloaded to allow a tester to define either an attribute/value combo, or just an attribute name in the case of empty or boolean attributes.</p>
<p>When a <code>WebInspector</code> method that supports custom attribute checks runs, the attribute check will be appended to any default checks made to determine the given state of an element.</p>
<h3 id="disabled-elements">Disabled Elements</h3>
<p>The <code>getEnabledStateOfElement()</code> method checks <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> to determine whether the element is enabled for user input. This method presumes the element to be enabled, and performs each check in an attempt to prove the element is disabled.</p>
<p>To specify a custom attribute that determines the element as disabled, the <code>setDisabledByAttribute()</code> method on the <code>Locator</code> must be called.</p>
<p>Consider an example where a form is present on the UI that contains a checkbox that is only enabled for input under specific conditions. The form UI is heavily stylized, and the UI developer has chosen to create checkboxes using CSS, with no underlying <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element. The tester has identified the CSS class that renders the checkbox inoperable, and will configure the <code>Locator</code> to provide this information to <code>WebInspector</code> to yield accurate inspections.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Locator iAgreeCheckbox = new Locator(&#34;I Agree Checkbox&#34;, &#34;#i-agree&#34;)
        .setDisabledByAttribute(&#34;class&#34;, &#34;checkbox-disabled&#34;);
</code></pre><h3 id="hidden-elements">Hidden Elements</h3>
<p>The <code>getVisibilityOfElement()</code> method checks for elements that match the provided selector, dimensions of the element, and standard W3C defined means of rendering elements invisible. This method presumes the element to be visible, and performs each of the checks to attempt to prove the element is in fact hidden until a check proves the element hidden (and returns a result accordingly), or no additional checks can be made (in which case the element is determined to indeed be visible).</p>
<p>To specify a custom attribute that defines the element as hidden, the <code>setHiddenByAttribute()</code> method must be called.</p>
<p>Consider an example of a &ldquo;Confirm&rdquo; button that is present on a form page, but is hidden from view until the form input has been completed by the user. Unfortunately, the UI developers have taken an unconventional approach to hiding this element, and normal visibility inspections are determining the element is visible. The tester has identified the CSS class that hides the element, and is able to pass this information to the <code>WebInspector</code> for a more accurate result.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Locator confirmButton = new Locator(&#34;Confirm Button&#34;, &#34;.customButton-confirm&#34;)
        .setHiddenByAttribute(&#34;class&#34;, &#34;invisible&#34;);
</code></pre><h3 id="selected-elements">Selected Elements</h3>
<p>The <code>getSelectedStateOfElement()</code> method checks element such as checkboxes, options in a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> menu, and radio buttons to determine whether the element is selected. This method presumes the element to be unselected and performs each check in an attempt to prove the element to be selected.</p>
<p>To specify a custom attribute that defines the element as selected, the <code>setSelectedByAttribute()</code> method must be called.</p>
<p>Revisiting the example above for the disabled checkbox, the UI developer has also created an animated interaction when the checkbox is selected. The tester has identified the resulting CSS class responsible for rendering the checkbox as checked, and will configure the <code>Locator</code> as required.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Locator iAgreeCheckbox = new Locator(&#34;I Agree Checkbox&#34;, &#34;#i-agree&#34;)
        .setSelectedByAttribute(&#34;class&#34;, &#34;checkbox-checked&#34;);
</code></pre><h3 id="fluent-design">Fluent Design</h3>
<p>The setters on the <code>Locator</code> for each of the element state attributes all return a self-reference. This allows the setter calls to be chained together. In the examples above where the &ldquo;I Agree&rdquo; checkbox has both disabled-by and selected-by attributes defined, the <code>Locator</code> can be instantiated and both configurations can be made in one chained method call.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Locator iAgreeCheckbox = new Locator(&#34;I Agree Checkbox&#34;, &#34;#i-agree&#34;)
        .setDisabledByAttribute(&#34;class&#34;, &#34;checkbox-disabled&#34;)
        .setSelectedByAttribute(&#34;class&#34;, &#34;checkbox-checked&#34;);
</code></pre><h2 id="the-locatorgroup">The LocatorGroup</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/qadenz/automation/ui/LocatorGroup.java"><code>LocatorGroup</code></a> allows multiple <code>Locator</code> instances to be combined together on a <code>List</code>, and acted upon as a group. This is commonly applied to verify the visibility of UI component, or a set of default UI elements. Instead of passing multiple individual Conditions to a <code>.verify()</code> or <code>.check()</code> validation, a <code>LocatorGroup</code> can be verified with a single <code>Condition</code> call.</p>
<p>For example, a simple authentication form has several basic elements, the &lsquo;Username&rsquo; field, the &lsquo;Password&rsquo; field, a &lsquo;Remember Me&rsquo; checkbox, and a &lsquo;Sign In&rsquo; button. Each element would be mapped as an individual <code>Locator</code> instance for the purposes of input, but these same elements could also be included in a <code>LocatorGroup</code>, should the need arise to verify each element to be visible as part of the form.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Locator usernameField = new Locator(&#34;Username Field&#34;, &#34;#username&#34;);
Locator passwordField = new Locator(&#34;Password Field&#34;, &#34;#password&#34;);
Locator rememberMeCheckbox = new Locator(&#34;Remember Me Checkbox&#34;, &#34;#remember-me&#34;);
Locator signInButton = new Locator(&#34;Sign In Button&#34;, &#34;#sign-in&#34;);

LocatorGroup signInForm = new LocatorGroup(&#34;Sign In Form&#34;,
        usernameField, passwordField, rememberMeCheckbox, signInButton);
</code></pre><p>By combining individual Locators onto a <code>LocatorGroup</code> instance, testers are able to identify and refer to collections of elements as the UI Components they represent.</p>
<h2 id="page-objects">Page Objects</h2>
<p>With Qadenz placing focus on the <code>Locator</code> component, this leaves the design of any Page Object implementation is left as open ended as possible. This is done to allow any given team to design and implement an UI Model layer that fits their needs and the modeling needs of their UI under test.</p>
<p>Qadenz does not force a particular means of initializing Page Objects like the <code>PageFactory</code>. In fact, unless a more sophisticated implementation is needed by a team, Locator-based UI Models can be initialized by simply calling a constructor.</p>
<h3 id="ui-models-as-locator-maps">UI Models as Locator Maps</h3>
<p>A team could choose simply to create Page classes that only declare and return <code>Locator</code> instances, then instantiate and call the Commands classes directly within their tests. The resulting tests would be slightly more verbose, but completely self-contained, requiring no stepping through code calls to follow the logic path. This does not allow for much abstraction of common test steps, but for simple and small test projects, it enables quick development.</p>
<h3 id="ui-models-with-simple-or-complex-actions">UI Models with Simple or Complex Actions</h3>
<p>Alternately, a team could choose to create Page classes that both store <code>Locators</code> as well as instances of Commands classes, then expose individual methods that perform singular actions against mapped elements. The Page classes would be instantiated somewhere accessible to the test, and the resulting code calls in the test would be clean and concise. With descriptive method names on the Page classes, minimal stepping through code would be required in order to infer the logic path.</p>
<p>Should the tests be more complex, or the UI workflows containing repetitive tasks, a team could build upon the above design and add more complex procedure methods that call multiple individual actions. This lessens the code required directly in a test, but with descriptive method names the resulting code calls would remain clean and concise. More reusable code is created, but would require a moderate amount of stepping through code calls in order to follow the details of the logic path.</p>
<p>A secondary benefit of this and similar designs is the logger injection for the Commands classes. <code>WebCommander</code> and <code>WebInspector</code> both use overloaded constructors to allow users to choose either a default logger or custom logger. A default logger will result in logging and reporting output that shows events originating from the Commands classes. Using a custom logger, teams can pass the <code>.class</code> value of the Page class to the <code>WebCommander</code> and <code>WebInspector</code> instances that reside on the Page class. This results in logging and reporting output that shows events originating from the Page classes, adding better clarity to the reporting output. This is explained in more detail in the <a href="#commands">Commands</a> section.</p>
<p>Finally, if the Page classes are becoming too cumbersome due to a complex UI, the Locators could be separated into a Map class, allowing for some division in the UI Modeling components. A test would call a Page class in order to perform actions against elements, and the Page class would call the Map class in order to retrieve the element mappings.</p>
